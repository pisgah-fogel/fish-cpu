# Fish-cpu
An fish-based processor, Part of the YARPA project (Yet Another Ridiculous Processor Architure)

## Disclaim
This project is a proof of concept of a very very silly idea: can we make a
CPU out of fish ? (living)
If something comes to work out of this, this is absolutely unintended.

## Help us ?
Any help is welcome !
Do you understand that you need to simulate/use fish ? Yes ? So let's fork and
contribute !
